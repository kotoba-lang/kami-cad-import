(ns cad-import.jbeam-physics-smoke-test
  "Physics smoke test -- load each demo vehicle through the full
   emit -> load chain, place it on a flat ground, and step the
   simulator for ~1 second. We don't tune anything for performance
   here; we only confirm that:

   1. `vehicle.vehicle/step` doesn't throw
   2. No node position becomes NaN / infinite
   3. The centre of mass doesn't fly off into space
   4. Beam breakage during settling is bounded (a few hardpoints
      failing is fine; a cascade would mean the spring constants are
      catastrophically wrong)

   Ported 1:1 from the original crate's `tests/jbeam_physics_smoke.rs`
   (kami-cad-import, kotoba-lang/kami-engine, deleted PR #82),
   ADR-2607010930. Uses `vehicle.*` (kotoba-lang/kami-vehicle, also
   restored to CLJC under the same ADR) for the actual physics step."
