(ns cad-import.jbeam-loadback-test
  "Integration test — emit JBeam data for the demo assemblies, then load
   it back through `vehicle.jbeam/load-edn` (kotoba-lang/kami-vehicle,
   also restored to CLJC under ADR-2607010930) and verify the resulting
   `Vehicle` matches the topology promised by `cad-import.jbeam-emit`.

   Ported 1:1 from the original crate's `tests/jbeam_loadback.rs`
   (kami-cad-import, kotoba-lang/kami-engine, deleted PR #82). The
   original round-tripped through a JSON *string*
   (`kami_vehicle::jbeam::load_str`); this port hands the emitted
   Clojure map straight to `vehicle.jbeam/load-edn`, skipping
   serialisation entirely — see `cad-import.jbeam-emit`'s namespace
   docstring.

   This proves the emitter output is not just structurally well-formed
   data but is *semantically valid* JBeam that the actual soft-body
   simulator accepts.

   Settle / step physics is intentionally NOT exercised here — the
   roadster's emitted spring constants come from the material table and
   aren't tuned for kami-vehicle's default damping (see
   `cad-import.jbeam-physics-smoke-test` for the settle/step smoke
   coverage that *is* ported, with generous tolerances)."
